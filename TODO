Enable sysctl based protection
Additionally we can tweak kernel and system variables in our server. Edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf, and set these two lines to 1 like this:

net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

The first parameter enables protection against IP spoofing, and the second allows TCP SYN cookie protection.
